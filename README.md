=================

LED candle using the Microchip PIC 12f683

The code is inspired and adapted from this nice example: http://ledhacker.blogspot.ro/

The code is written with mikroC (it should work fine with the demo version) and tested on the EasyPIC5 dev board.

Pictures following as soon as I get it mounted.
